Fixing the problem will require more than increasing the I.R.S.’s budget (though that would certainly help). It’s about having the right personnel with the right skills. Today, the wealthy and corporations have the I.R.S. outgunned. The ultra-affluent — with the help of legions of tax professionals — make domestic income disappear overseas or hide it in a pyramid of partnerships. It’s like trying to take on a modern army while armed with spears and clubs.
